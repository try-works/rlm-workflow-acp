# RLM Artifact Writing Guide and Templates

Use this file when writing any per-run artifact in:
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/00-worktree.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/00-requirements.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/01-as-is.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02-to-be-plan.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/03-implementation-summary.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/04-test-summary.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/05-manual-qa.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.lock.md` (optional, sealed ACP execution contract after planning, before delegated execution)
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/addenda/*.md`

Operational sidecar (not canonical content):
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.state.json`

This guide is intentionally prescriptive so two different agents produce equivalent artifacts.

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Resolve the run id and exact output path.
2. **Ensure `00-requirements.md` exists, then create/lock Phase 0 worktree (`00-worktree.md`) before Phase 1+ (isolated workspace setup).**
3. **If writing Phase 3 or later, verify all prior phase artifacts are lock-valid before proceeding.**
4. Verify phase isolation: only the current phase may be `DRAFT`; do not proceed if a prior phase is unresolved.
5. Determine effective inputs:
   - base input files for this phase
   - plus stage-local addenda for each base input, lexical order
6. Write the required header with exact input/output paths.
7. Write phase-specific content sections from this guide.
8. Write `Traceability`, `Coverage Gate`, and `Approval Gate`.
9. Perform a pre-lock completeness check using this template's required sections and gates.
10. Verify LockHash matches SHA-256 of content before locking.
11. Lock only after both gates pass (`Status`, `LockedAt`, `LockHash`).

## Required Header (All Artifacts)

```md
Run: `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/`
Phase: `0N <phase-name>`
Status: `DRAFT`
Inputs:
- `/<path-to-input-1>`
- `/<path-to-input-2>`
Outputs:
- `/<path-to-this-output>`
Scope note: One short paragraph describing what this artifact decides or enables.
```

When locking, append:

```md
LockedAt: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
LockHash: `<sha256-hex>`
```

## Universal Sections (All Artifacts Except `00-requirements.md`)

Traceability is not required in `00-requirements.md`, but every downstream artifact (Phase 1+) must include it.

```md
## Traceability

- `R1` -> [where this artifact addresses it] | Evidence: [files, commands, observations]
- `R2` -> [where this artifact addresses it] | Evidence: [files, commands, observations]
- `R3` -> Deferred in this phase | Rationale: [...] | Impact: [...]
```

```md
## Coverage Gate

- Effective inputs reviewed:
  - `/<base-input-1>`
  - `/<matching-addendum-1>`
  - `/<matching-addendum-2>`
- Requirement coverage check:
  - `R1`: Covered at [section]
  - `R2`: Covered at [section]
  - `R3`: Deferred [why]
- Out-of-scope confirmation:
  - `OOS1`: unchanged
  - `OOS2`: unchanged

Coverage: PASS
```

```md
## Approval Gate

- Objective readiness checks:
  - [artifact is internally consistent]
  - [commands are runnable and specific]
  - [tests/QA expectations are explicit for this phase]
  - [no required section is missing]
- Remaining blockers:
  - none

Approval: PASS
```

If either gate fails, set `FAIL` and list exact fixes required before proceeding.

## Evidence Directory (Per Run)

To keep Phase 4/5 fast and reproducible, store all non-Markdown evidence artifacts under a standard folder:

- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/evidence/`
  - `screenshots/` (UI screenshots, failure screenshots)
  - `logs/` (console/server/CI excerpts)
  - `perf/` (profiles, measurements, benchmarks)
  - `traces/` (Playwright traces, HARs; if applicable)
  - `other/` (fallback)

Reference these artifacts in Phase 3/4/5 using repo-relative paths.

## ACP Handoff Contract Template (`02.5-acp-handoff.lock.md`) - Optional

Purpose:
- Seal a bounded execution contract so Codex (supervisor) can delegate Phase 3 implementation and/or Phase 4 testing to a worker agent via ACP (`acpx`) without using ACP as the durable record.

When it is created:
- After `02-to-be-plan.md` is available (planning complete for the delegated scope).
- Only when the run is in a delegable state (required prior artifacts exist and lock chain is valid).
- Only for bounded tasks where completion can be reviewed from code diff + updated artifacts.
- Before invoking `scripts/delegate-to-kimi.py`.

Lock semantics (handoff hash):
- The handoff file is sealed by recording `Algorithm: sha256` and a `Hash: <hex>` value under `## Lock`.
- The wrapper must verify the hash before invoking Kimi.
- Canonical hash input for `Hash:`:
  - normalize newlines to LF (`\n`)
  - remove the `Hash:` line entirely (including its trailing newline, if present)
  - compute SHA-256 over the resulting UTF-8 text

Quick hash computation:

PowerShell:
```powershell
$p = ".codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.lock.md"
$t = Get-Content -LiteralPath $p -Raw -Encoding UTF8
$n = ($t -replace "`r`n","`n") -replace "`r","`n"
$n = $n -replace "(?m)^[ \t]*Hash:.*(?:`n|$)",""
$b = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($n)
$h = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create().ComputeHash($b)
($h | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("x2") }) -join ""
```

Python:
```bash
python -c "import hashlib,re,pathlib; p=pathlib.Path('.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.lock.md'); t=p.read_text(encoding='utf-8'); n=t.replace('\\r\\n','\\n').replace('\\r','\\n'); n=re.sub(r'(?m)^[ \\t]*Hash:.*(?:\\n|$)','',n); print(hashlib.sha256(n.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest())"
```

Machine sidecar (operational only):
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.state.json` tracks invocation status/session metadata.
- This JSON is not canonical implementation content and must not be used as a substitute for RLM artifacts.

Required sections (fail if missing):
- `Delegated Phases`
- `Run ID`
- `Delegation Origin`
- `Phase` (for traceability; the delegated scope is declared in `Delegated Phases`)
- `Requirement IDs`
- `Assigned Worktree Path`
- `Assigned Branch`
- `Created At`
- `## Lock` (with `Algorithm` and `Hash`)
- `## Input Artifacts`
- `## Required Artifact Updates`
- `## Current Worktree State Rules`
- `## Scope In`
- `## Scope Out`
- `## Required Verification`
- `## Artifact Ownership`
- `## Stop Conditions`
- `## Completion Conditions`

Template:

```md
# ACP Handoff

Run ID: <run-id>
Delegated Phases: 3 | 4 | 3,4
Delegation Origin: <where/why this was delegated>
Phase: <phase name>
Requirement IDs: <ids>
Assigned Worktree Path: <path>
Assigned Branch: <branch>
Created At: <timestamp>

## Lock
Algorithm: sha256
Hash: <hash>

## Input Artifacts
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/00-requirements.md`
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02-to-be-plan.md`
- ...

## Required Artifact Updates
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/03-implementation-summary.md` (if delegating Phase 3)
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/04-test-summary.md` (if delegating Phase 4)

## Current Worktree State Rules
- continue from the current assigned worktree state
- do not switch worktrees
- do not switch branches
- do not discard changes unless explicitly instructed

## Scope In
- ...

## Scope Out
- ...

## Required Verification
- Run required verification commands in the assigned worktree.
- For delegated Phase 4 testing, record command + exit code + result evidence.
- Windows (supported path): direct `kimi acp` Shell/Terminal execution via ACP `terminal/create` is unreliable; run verification via MCP tool `rlm_run_command` (argv-split) and write an evidence JSON file:
  - `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/evidence/logs/acp-verification.json`
  - `04-test-summary.md` should record `Verification Output Sha256:` matching the evidence `outputSha256`.
- Do not attempt to "enable" ACP shell support by adding `shell`/`terminal`/`acp` to Kimi model `capabilities` in `~/.kimi/config.toml`. Model capabilities are about media/thinking features, not ACP tool support.

## Artifact Ownership
- Kimi must write its own code changes
- Kimi must update its own RLM artifacts directly

## Stop Conditions
- ...

## Completion Conditions
- ...
```

## Addenda Templates

## Artifact Linting (Structure + TODO Discipline)

Before locking (or when a lock verification fails unexpectedly), lint the run artifacts for required header fields, required section headings, and TODO completion rules:

```powershell
# Python (cross-platform):
python ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>"
# Or, when running from this repo:
python ./scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>"
python3 ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>"
python3 ./scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>"

# Treat WARN as FAIL
python ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>" --strict
python ./scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>" --strict
python3 ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>" --strict
python3 ./scripts/lint-rlm-run.py --run-id "<run-id>" --strict

# Lint specific run
.\.agents\skills\rlm-workflow-acp\scripts\lint-rlm-run.ps1 -RunId "<run-id>"
# Or, when running from this repo:
.\scripts\lint-rlm-run.ps1 -RunId "<run-id>"

# Treat WARN as FAIL
.\.agents\skills\rlm-workflow-acp\scripts\lint-rlm-run.ps1 -RunId "<run-id>" -Strict
.\scripts\lint-rlm-run.ps1 -RunId "<run-id>" -Strict
```

## Locking Commands

PowerShell:

```powershell
$p = '.codex/rlm/<run-id>/<artifact>.md'
$t = Get-Content -LiteralPath $p -Raw -Encoding UTF8
$n = ($t -replace "`r`n","`n") -replace "(?m)^LockHash:.*(?:`n|$)",""
$b = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($n)
$h = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create().ComputeHash($b)
($h | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("x2") }) -join ""
```

Shell:

```bash
sed '/^LockHash:/d' .codex/rlm/<run-id>/<artifact>.md | tr -d '\r' | sha256sum
```

## Common Failure Modes (Use as Pre-Lock Checklist)

- Missing one or more effective-input addenda under `Inputs`.
- Coverage Gate says PASS but does not map every `R#`.
- Approval Gate says PASS with unresolved blockers.
- `Traceability` references vague evidence instead of concrete files/commands.
- Artifact locked without `LockedAt` and `LockHash`.
- **LockHash does not match SHA-256 of normalized content (tampering detected).**
- Editing locked prior-phase artifacts instead of writing addenda.
- Working on main/master branch without explicit consent documented.
- Worktree directory not git-ignored (project-local worktrees).
- Baseline tests failing (pre-existing issues not documented).

## Lock Verification

### Automated Verification

Use the provided script to verify all locks in a run:

```bash
# Verify specific run
python ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature"
# Or, when running from this repo:
python ./scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature"
python3 ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature"
python3 ./scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature"

# Fix incorrect hashes (use with caution)
python ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature" --fix
# Or, when running from this repo:
python ./scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature" --fix
python3 ./.agents/skills/rlm-workflow-acp/scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature" --fix
python3 ./scripts/verify-locks.py --run-id "2026-02-21-feature" --fix
```

```powershell
# Verify specific run
.\.agents\skills\rlm-workflow-acp\scripts\verify-locks.ps1 -RunId "2026-02-21-feature"
# Or, when running from this repo:
.\scripts\verify-locks.ps1 -RunId "2026-02-21-feature"

# Fix incorrect hashes (use with caution)
.\.agents\skills\rlm-workflow-acp\scripts\verify-locks.ps1 -RunId "2026-02-21-feature" -Fix
# Or, when running from this repo:
.\scripts\verify-locks.ps1 -RunId "2026-02-21-feature" -Fix
```

### Manual Verification

Compute SHA-256 hash:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$p = '.codex/rlm/<run-id>/<artifact>.md'
$t = Get-Content -LiteralPath $p -Raw -Encoding UTF8
$n = ($t -replace "`r`n","`n") -replace "(?m)^LockHash:.*(?:`n|$)",""
$b = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($n)
$h = [System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create().ComputeHash($b)
($h | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("x2") }) -join ""
```

**Shell:**
```bash
sed '/^LockHash:/d' .codex/rlm/<run-id>/<artifact>.md | tr -d '\r' | sha256sum
```

Compare computed hash with `LockHash` in artifact header. They must match exactly.
