# RLM Workflow (ACP)

A stage-gated Recursive Language Models (RLM) workflow for AI-assisted software development with strict phase gates, TDD discipline, and systematic debugging.

Distributed as Agent Skills; install via Skills CLI (works across supported agents).

This repository is the source/development repo. The installable root skill now lives at:

- `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/`

Unless explicitly noted otherwise, references below to the "main skill" mean:

- `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md`

## Installation

### Skills CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive install of the main skill
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp/skills/rlm-workflow-acp
```

**NOTE:** The repo root is no longer an installable skill folder.
The installable main skill lives at `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/`, and the repo also contains additional subskills under `skills/*`.
Use `--full-depth` from the repo root when you want to inspect or install the whole set.

#### List skills

```bash
# List the main installable skill directly
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp/skills/rlm-workflow-acp --list

# List ALL installable skills in the repo
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp --list --full-depth
```

#### Install skills

```bash
# Install all installable skills from the repo
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp --skill '*' --full-depth

# Global install (available everywhere)
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp --skill '*' --full-depth -g -y

# Install the main skill from its folder
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp/skills/rlm-workflow-acp

# Install a single subskill
# Option A (repo path):
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp/skills/rlm-tdd
# Option B (explicit skill selection):
npx skills add try-works/rlm-workflow-acp --skill rlm-tdd --full-depth
```

### Bootstrap

After installation, the skill auto-bootstraps on first invocation. To manually bootstrap:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/install-rlm-workflow.ps1" -RepoRoot .

# PowerShell 7+ (pwsh):
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/install-rlm-workflow.ps1" -RepoRoot .

# Python (Windows/macOS/Linux):
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/install-rlm-workflow.py" --repo-root .
# or:
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/install-rlm-workflow.py" --repo-root .

# Bash wrapper (macOS/Linux):
bash "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/install-rlm-workflow.sh" --repo-root .
```

Find the installed location via `npx skills list` (or use project-local install so `<SKILL_DIR>` is under `.agents/skills/...`).
Bootstrap writes managed marker blocks into existing `.codex/AGENTS.md` and `.agent/PLANS.md`, preserving unrelated existing content.
Installer bootstrap is cross-platform (`python`/`python3`/`bash` wrapper supported). Core utilities have Python equivalents (`scripts/*.py`) plus PowerShell equivalents (`scripts/*.ps1`).

## 1. Introduction to rlm-workflow-acp

`rlm-workflow-acp` is a skill/plugin for running the repository's RLM (Recursive Language Models) workflow with strict phase gates, traceability, locking, and addenda rules, plus an optional ACP delegation path to Kimi via `acpx`.

rlm-workflow-acp is inspired by the MIT paper 'Recursive Language Models'. While the paper reports increased performance, reduced context rot and an effective context window of 10 million tokens by using agents, agents are a sidetrack. The core finding is that important information such as requirements, implementation plans and current codebase analysis must NOT be part of the agent context but stored in static files. 

rlm-workflow-acp uses a standard kanban-workflow with distinct phases like requirements, codebase analysis, implementation plan, implementation summary, verification, manual QA of implementation, and then updating of global repo artifacts (STATE.md and DECISIONS.md) to document the codebase.

## 2. Why use it

- It keeps requirements and plans in repo files instead of chat context.
- It enforces deterministic phase outputs with explicit `Coverage Gate` and `Approval Gate`.
- It supports resumable, single-command execution for complex multi-phase work.
- It reduces regressions by requiring validation and manual QA sign-off flow.
- It increases effective context windows, multi-step run accuracy, by preventing context rot and requirement drift.
- It **isolates development** via git worktrees, preventing main branch pollution.
- It **protects the main branch** by requiring explicit consent to work directly on it.
- All historical implementations, including Why, What and How, can easily be audited in the .codex/rlm/ folder where each requirement has its own folder with locked artifacts per phase.

### Key Features

**Quality & Discipline**
- **TDD Discipline** - Strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with The Iron Law: *No production code without a failing test first*
- **Systematic Debugging** - Optional Phase 1.5 debug mode for bug fixes with 4-phase root cause analysis
- **TODO Discipline** - Mandatory checkable TODOs in every phase artifact; no locking with unchecked items

**Execution & Scaling**
- **Subagent-Driven Execution** - Automatic parallel execution with fallback to sequential mode
- **Phase 3.5 Code Review** - Optional subagent review between implementation and testing
- **Parallel Testing** - Concurrent test execution (unit, integration, E2E)

**ACP Delegation (Optional)**
- **Kimi Delegation via ACP (`acpx`)** - Codex can delegate bounded, implementation-heavy work to Kimi using a sealed handoff artifact and a thin local wrapper script.

**Safety & Control**
- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Isolated workspace setup (REQUIRED before other phases)
- **Branch Protection** - Prevents main branch work without explicit consent
- **Lock Verification** - Automated SHA-256 lock hash validation (normalized artifact content; see below)
- **Hard Gates** - Non-negotiable checkpoints marked with `<HG>` tags prevent skipping steps

## ACP Delegation to Kimi (Optional)

This repo adds an additive delegation mode for bounded implementation-heavy tasks:

- **Codex** remains supervisor and source-of-truth reader.
- **Kimi** is the implementation worker (writes code and updates artifacts directly).
- **ACP** is control-plane only (session control + prompt delivery via `acpx`).

### When to Use

Use delegation only when:
- The run is initialized and lock chain is valid for all prior required phases.
- The task is bounded and reviewable via code diff + updated artifacts.
- The worktree path and branch are known and must not change.

Do not use delegation for ambiguous scope, broad architecture work, or tasks requiring ongoing product decisions.

### Prerequisites

- `acpx` installed and on PATH
- `kimi` available via `acpx` (auth configured)
- **Windows (supported path):** direct `kimi acp` Shell/Terminal execution via ACP `terminal/create` is unreliable. For delegated Phase 4 testing on Windows, `rlm-workflow-acp` uses an MCP argv-runner workaround (`rlm-command-runner` + `rlm_run_command`) to execute verification *inside* the delegated ACP session and write an evidence JSON file.
- Do **not** try to "enable" `shell`/`terminal`/`acp` by adding them to Kimi model `capabilities` in `~/.kimi/config.toml`. Kimi model capabilities are about media/thinking features, not ACP tool support.

### Windows Execution Policy

`rlm-workflow-acp` supports ACP delegation on Windows with this policy:
- ACP (`acpx`) is the control plane only (session + prompt delivery).
- Kimi writes code and RLM artifacts directly in the assigned worktree/run folder.
- Delegated verification (Phase 4) is executed inside the delegated ACP session via the MCP argv-runner (`rlm-command-runner` / `rlm_run_command`) and must produce an evidence JSON file under the run folder.
- Direct `kimi acp` Shell/Terminal execution via ACP `terminal/create` is treated as unreliable/unsupported on Windows for now.

What Moonshot needs to fix in Kimi Code CLI for full ACP-on-Windows support:
- In ACP mode, the `Shell` tool is replaced with an ACP terminal-backed tool. Today it calls `terminal/create` with a single combined command string. On Windows this fails because the ACP client tries to spawn an executable literally named like `"python -m unittest ..."` instead of an argv-split command.
- The fix is to pass argv correctly to ACP: call `terminal/create(command=<executable>, args=[...])` (or wrap via `powershell.exe -command <string>` like the non-ACP Shell tool does), and include `cwd` so execution happens in the assigned worktree.

### Delegation Contract Artifact

Codex creates and seals:
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.lock.md` (sealed ACP execution contract after planning, before delegated execution)
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.state.json` (operational sidecar; not canonical)
- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/02.5-acp-handoff.validation-report.md` (generated on validation failure; actionable repair instructions; not canonical)

`02.5-acp-handoff.state.json` records both:
- `acpStatus` / `acpReturnCode`: whether the ACP invocation itself succeeded
- `validationStatus`: whether repo-mediated completion validation passed

This prevents "false failure" confusion: ACP can succeed while validation fails due to missing/malformed evidence or outcome fields.

#### Note on `02.5-acp-handoff.validation-report.md`

The validation report file may remain on disk even after a successful repair pass. The authoritative source of truth is the state sidecar:
- `validationStatus`
- `validationProblems`
- `validationReport`

If `validationStatus: "success"` and `validationReport: null`, any leftover `02.5-acp-handoff.validation-report.md` should be treated as historical/debugging context, not an active blocker.

The handoff must explicitly declare:
- `Delegated Phases: 3 | 4 | 3,4`
- `## Required Artifact Updates` (which artifacts Kimi must update based on delegated phases)

### Running Delegation

From the target repo root (or from this repo when developing the skill):

```bash
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/delegate-to-kimi.py" --run "<run-id>"
python "./scripts/delegate-to-kimi.py" --run "<run-id>"
```

### Delegation Modes and Session Policy

`delegate-to-kimi.py` now supports explicit delegation modes:

- `implement`
- `review`
- `repair`

And explicit session policy:

- `exec`
- `persistent`
- `auto`

Recommended defaults:

- bounded implementation: `--mode implement --session-policy auto`
- review passes: `--mode review --session-policy exec`
- repair passes: `--mode repair --session-policy exec`

`auto` resolves to one-shot `exec` for `review` and `repair`, and to `exec` for `implement` unless the sealed handoff declares `## Multi-Turn Requirement` as required.

Additional override flags:

- `--slice <name>` selects `02.5-acp-handoff.<name>.lock.md` / `.state.json`
- `--role-template <implementer|reviewer|repairer|path>` overrides the prompt template source for all ACP sub-attempts in the run, including automatic review/repair follow-up attempts
- `--owned-write-files <path>` narrows or replaces the owned write set
- `--allowed-read-paths <path>` narrows or replaces advisory read hints only; this is not machine-enforced today
- `--output-contract <contract>` proposes a different completion contract
- `--allow-sealed-override` is required before `--output-contract` may override the sealed handoff in normal runs

Sealed handoff authority:

- the sealed handoff remains authoritative by default
- if `--output-contract` disagrees with the sealed handoff and `--allow-sealed-override` is not present, the run is rejected
- if `--allow-sealed-override` is used, the unsafe override is recorded in state/transcript metadata

### Automated Review and Repair Loops

For `implement` mode, the wrapper can run a bounded follow-up loop:

1. implement
2. validate repo-mediated completion
3. run review mode
4. if review returns defects or validation fails, run repair mode
5. re-validate and re-review until success or the loop budget is exhausted

Use `--max-review-loops <n>` to control the budget. The current default is `2`.
Both the Python and PowerShell entrypoints forward the exact loop count you set. `0` is a valid explicit value and disables the automatic review/repair loop.

### Transcript Evidence

ACP transcripts are always written for every ACP sub-attempt. The `--save-transcript` flag remains accepted only as a backward-compatible no-op.

Each ACP sub-attempt writes a transcript bundle under:

- `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/evidence/acp/attempt-XXX/`

The bundle includes:

- `prompt.txt`
- `stdout.txt`
- `stderr.txt`
- `invocation.json`

`invocation.json` records execution details such as:

- `mode`
- `sessionPolicy`
- `delegationRole`
- `roleTemplate`
- `usedValidationReport`
- `ownedWriteFiles`
- `allowedReadPathsAdvisory`
- `requiredWorktreeChanges`
- `forcedSessionPolicy`

This always-on transcript policy is intentional: repo-mediated validation and auditability rely on having the ACP prompt/output bundle available after each attempt.

Review-mode output contract:

- `NO_DEFECTS` on a single line is always valid.
- Otherwise, every top-level bullet or numbered item must be a concrete defect in one of these shapes:
  - `path/to/file.ts: concrete issue`
  - `path/to/file.ts:123 concrete issue`
  - `` `/.codex/rlm/<run-id>/03.5-code-review.md`: concrete issue ``
- Checklist/TODO bullets like `- verify tests` or `- update docs` are invalid and fail repo-mediated review validation.

### Functional Smoke Test (ACP Delegation)

This repo includes a manual functional smoke test that sets up a dedicated worktree + fixture + run folder and can exercise multiple ACP scenarios:

```bash
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py"
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py" --list-scenarios
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py" --scenario implement-persistent
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py" --scenario review-exec
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py" --scenario ownership-violation
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py" --scenario dirty-baseline-validation
python "./scripts/smoke-acp-functional.py" --scenario multi-slice-disjoint
```

Supported scenarios:

- `implement-exec` - one-shot implement mode with review loop enabled
- `implement-persistent` - persistent-session implement mode
- `review-exec` - review-only run using `defects_or_no_defects`
- `ownership-violation` - validation-only scenario proving owned-write enforcement rejects unrelated tracked changes
- `dirty-baseline-validation` - validation-only scenario proving pre-existing dirty tracked files are ignored unless they change again
- `multi-slice-disjoint` - validation-only scenario proving both `sp1` and `sp2` validate within their own owned write sets, and that `sp1` rejects cross-slice tracked writes into `sp2`-owned files

Scenario execution model:

- ACP-invoking scenarios: `implement-exec`, `implement-persistent`, `review-exec`
- Validation-only scenarios: `ownership-violation`, `dirty-baseline-validation`, `multi-slice-disjoint`
- Positive validation-only scenarios still satisfy the same repo-mediated evidence contract as delegated Phase 4 runs.

For the positive validation-only scenarios, the smoke harness now writes deterministic verification evidence JSON under the run folder so repo-mediated validation matches the same evidence contract used by real delegated Phase 4 runs.

### Completion Determination (Repo-Mediated)

Delegation is complete only if all are true:
1. ACP invocation completed successfully.
2. Worktree path and branch still match the sealed handoff.
3. Required artifact updates exist in the run folder.
4. A non-empty `## ACP Delegation Outcome` section exists in each artifact listed under `## Required Artifact Updates` in the sealed handoff.
5. If the handoff requires verification evidence (e.g. `Evidence JSON: ...`), the evidence file exists and (for Phase 4) `04-test-summary.md` records `Verification Output Sha256:` matching the evidence `outputSha256`.
6. Ownership validation is dirty-worktree-safe: pre-existing tracked dirt is ignored unless its file content changes again relative to the captured delegation-start snapshot.
7. First-run `--validate-only` captures baseline head and dirty tracked snapshots before validation, so it follows the same dirty-worktree-safe ownership rules as normal delegation.

### Intentionally Out of Scope

- No daemon, scheduler, queue, or dashboard
- No artifact transport over ACP (repo/worktree artifacts remain the durable record)
- No generalized multi-worker orchestration or merge automation

## 3. How to use it

1. Install with:
  - `npx skills add https://github.com/try-works/rlm-workflow-acp --skill rlm-workflow-acp`
2. Create a run folder and Phase 0 Requirements artifact:
   - Path: `.codex/rlm/<run-id>/00-requirements.md`
   - Example: I create the folder for my first requirements as: /rlm/00-my-first-requirements
   - I then create the requirements doc inside the same folder: /00-my-first-requirements/00-requirements.md
   - Ideally, these requirements should be fleshed out with an agent beforehand, but they can also be simple ("add a button to delete these feed items"), and the agent will flesh out the requirements for you as part of the workflow.
3. Invoke execution:
   - `Implement requirement '<run-id>'`
   - Example: `Implement requirement 00-my-first-requirements`
   - What it does: runs/resumes phases automatically in order. The requirements doc will be read and formatted according to workflow rules.
   - User input required: No (until manual QA phase).
4. **Phase 0 Worktree Setup (`00-worktree.md`) - Isolation (REQUIRED):**
   - **The Iron Law:** Never work on main/master without explicit consent
   - What it does: creates isolated git worktree, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline
   - **Safety:** Verifies worktree directory is git-ignored
   - **Baseline:** All tests passing before changes begin
   - User input required: No (auto-creates worktree if on main branch).
5. Phase 1 (`01-as-is.md`) - AS-IS analysis:
   - What it does: captures current behavior, repro steps, code pointers, known unknowns.
   - **Context:** Executes in isolated worktree
   - User input required: Usually no.
6. **Phase 1.5 (`01.5-root-cause.md`) - Root Cause Analysis (optional, debug mode):**
   - **When:** For bug fixes, test failures, unexpected behavior
   - What it does: systematic 4-phase debugging (error analysis -> reproduction -> data flow tracing -> hypothesis testing)
   - **The Iron Law:** No fixes without root cause investigation first
   - User input required: No.
7. Phase 2 (`02-to-be-plan.md`) - TO-BE plan:
   - What it does: creates an ExecPlan-grade implementation + validation plan (including tests and manual QA scenarios).
   - If Phase 1.5 exists: incorporates root cause findings into fix plan
   - User input required: Usually no, unless the user wants to refine scope/tradeoffs.
8. **Phase 3 (`03-implementation-summary.md`) - Implementation (TDD Discipline + Parallelization):**
   - What it does: applies planned code changes and records what changed and why.
   - **The Iron Law:** No production code without a failing test first
   - **Required:** TDD Compliance Log documenting RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
   - **Execution Modes:**
     - **Parallel Mode:** Dispatch subagents for independent sub-phases (3x faster)
     - **Sequential Mode:** Execute sub-phases sequentially in main agent (fallback)
   - User input required: No.
9. **Phase 3.5 (`03.5-code-review.md`) - Code Review (optional):**
   - **When:** High-risk changes, complex sub-phases, or extra confidence needed
   - What it does: subagent review of implementation against plan and coding standards
   - **Parallel Mode:** Independent `code-reviewer` subagent
   - **Sequential Mode:** Extended self-review checklist
   - User input required: No.
10. Phase 4 (`04-test-summary.md`) - Tests and validation:
   - What it does: audits implementation-first (Phase 3 summary vs `00-requirements.md` and `02-to-be-plan.md`), then runs planned validation and records commands/results/evidence.
   - Verifies TDD compliance: all tests from Phase 3 passing
   - **Parallel Mode:** Concurrent test suites (unit + integration + E2E)
   - **Sequential Mode:** Run test suites sequentially
   - User input required: No.
11. Phase 5 (`05-manual-qa.md`) - Manual QA sign-off:
   - What it does: pauses for human QA execution and records observed results.
   - User input required: Yes (the user must run QA scenarios and provide sign-off or failure notes).
12. Phase 6 - Global decisions update:
   - Artifact updated: `.codex/DECISIONS.md`
   - What it does: records what changed, why, and references all run artifacts.
   - User input required: No.
13. Phase 7 - Global state update:
   - Artifact updated: `.codex/STATE.md`
   - What it does: updates current system state to reflect the final implemented behavior.
   - User input required: No.

Optional phase-specific control:
   - Example: `Run RLM Phase 3 for 00-my-first-requirements`
   - What it does: executes only one selected phase, but still enforces sequential lock-chain rules.
   - User input required: Depends on phase (manual input required at Phase 5 only).

## Execution Modes

RLM automatically detects subagent capabilities and selects the optimal execution mode:

### Parallel Mode (Subagents Available)

When subagent spawning is available (Claude Code `Task` tool, Codex native subagents, etc.):

**Phase 3 - Parallel Implementation:**
- Controller dispatches implementer subagents for independent sub-phases concurrently
- Two-stage review: spec compliance -> code quality
- Review loops until each sub-phase is approved
- Integration testing after all sub-phases complete

**Phase 3.5 - Independent Review:**
- `code-reviewer` subagent evaluates against plan and standards
- Severity classification (Critical/Important/Minor)
- Fixes loop until approved

**Phase 4 - Parallel Testing:**
- Controller performs pre-test implementation audit (`03-implementation-summary.md` vs `00-requirements.md` + `02-to-be-plan.md`)
- Subagent 1: Unit tests
- Subagent 2: Integration tests
- Subagent 3: E2E Tier A
- All run concurrently, results aggregated

### Sequential Mode (Fallback)

When subagents are unavailable (platform limitation, user request):

- Sub-phases executed sequentially in main agent
- Extended self-review checklist
- Integration testing between each sub-phase
- Slower but equally rigorous

### Mode Detection

**Automatic at Phase 3 start:**
```
1. Check for agent/Task tool capability
2. If available -> Use PARALLEL mode
3. If unavailable -> Use SEQUENTIAL mode
```

**Platforms:**
- **Claude Code:** Parallel if `Task` tool available
- **Codex:** Parallel if native subagent support
- **OpenCode:** Check `skill` tool capabilities
- **Cursor:** Usually sequential (limited subagent support)

## 4. What it does

- Executes RLM phases using `.agent/PLANS.md` as canonical rules.
- Writes and updates run artifacts under `.codex/rlm/<run-id>/`.
- Applies effective-input processing (base artifact + addenda).
- Produces traceability mappings from `R#` to evidence.
- Locks artifacts only when gates pass, with `LockedAt` and `LockHash`.
- Enforces hard-stop phase transition checks so later phases cannot run unless prior phases are lock-valid.
- Enforces strict phase isolation: only one active/DRAFT phase is allowed per run.
- Handles manual QA pause/resume behavior for Phase 5.

## 5. Verification & Safety

### Lock Verification

Verify integrity of locked artifacts:

`LockHash` is computed from a canonical normalized form of the artifact text (LF newlines, with the `LockHash:` line removed). Use the provided verifier script rather than hashing the raw file bytes directly.

```powershell
# Python verifier (cross-platform)
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>"
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.py" --repo-root .
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>" --fix
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>"
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.py" --repo-root .
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>" --fix

# PowerShell verifier (equivalent)

# Verify specific run
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>"
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>"

# Scan all runs
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.ps1" -RepoRoot .
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.ps1" -RepoRoot .

# Fix incorrect hashes (use with caution; indicates post-lock modifications)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>" -Fix
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify-locks.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>" -Fix
```

Find the installed location via `npx skills list` (or use project-local install so `<SKILL_DIR>` is under `.agents/skills/...`).

### Run Initialization

Create a run folder with `addenda/` and standardized `evidence/` subfolders, plus a `00-requirements.md` template:

```powershell
# Python (cross-platform):
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-init.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>" --template feature
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-init.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>" --template feature

# Windows PowerShell:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-init.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>" -Template feature

# PowerShell 7+ (pwsh):
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-init.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>" -Template feature
```

### Run Status

Show current run phase, lock chain progress, and evidence folder status:

```powershell
# Python (cross-platform):
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>"
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.py" --repo-root .
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>"
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.py" --repo-root .

# Windows PowerShell:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.ps1" -RepoRoot .

# PowerShell 7+ (pwsh):
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>"
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/rlm-status.ps1" -RepoRoot .
```

### Artifact Linting (Structure + TODO Discipline)

Lint artifacts for required header fields, required sections, and TODO completion rules (especially before locking):

```powershell
# Python (cross-platform):
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>"
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>" --strict
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>"
python3 "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.py" --repo-root . --run-id "<run-id>" --strict

# Windows PowerShell:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>"

# PowerShell 7+ (pwsh):
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>"

# Treat WARN as FAIL (both):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>" -Strict
pwsh -NoProfile -File "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/lint-rlm-run.ps1" -RepoRoot . -RunId "<run-id>" -Strict
```

### Evidence Directory Convention

Store non-Markdown evidence artifacts under:

- `.codex/rlm/<run-id>/evidence/`
  - `screenshots/` (UI screenshots, failure screenshots)
  - `logs/` (console/server/CI excerpts)
  - `perf/` (profiles, measurements, benchmarks)
  - `traces/` (Playwright traces, HARs; if applicable)

Reference these paths from Phase 4 (`04-test-summary.md`) and Phase 5 (`05-manual-qa.md`).

### Worktree Status

Check if you're in an isolated worktree:

```bash
# Show current worktree
git worktree list

# Should show: /path/to/project/.worktrees/<run-id>
# NOT: /path/to/project (main working tree)
```

### Branch Protection

If you accidentally start on main branch, the workflow will:
1. Display a warning
2. Create an isolated worktree (default)
3. Require explicit consent to proceed on main

### Clean Baseline

Before making changes, Phase 0 verifies:
- All tests passing
- No uncommitted changes
- Known starting state

This ensures any failures are due to your changes, not pre-existing issues.

### Skill Priority System

When a requirement involves multiple concerns, the workflow applies skills in priority order:

| Priority | Concern | When to Apply |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Debugging** | Bug fixes, crashes, test failures -> Run Phase 1.5 first |
| 2 | **Design** | New features -> Complete Phase 1 (AS-IS) before planning |
| 3 | **Implementation** | After analysis complete -> Proceed to Phase 3+ |
| 4 | **Testing** | All implementation -> Use TDD discipline in Phase 3 |
| 5 | **Review** | After implementation -> Optional Phase 3.5 Code Review |

**Example:** "Fix login crash" -> Debugging priority -> Phase 1.5 (Root Cause) before Phase 2 (Planning)

### Hard Gates

Hard gates (`<HG>`) are non-negotiable checkpoints that prevent skipping steps:

| Gate | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| **HG-0** | Do NOT proceed to Phase 1 or 2 until worktree is created and verified and Phase 0 is LOCKED |
| **HG-1** | Do NOT create Phase 2 plan until Phase 1 is LOCKED (and Phase 1.5 is LOCKED when present) |
| **HG-2** | Do NOT create TO-BE plan in debug mode until Phase 1.5 root cause analysis is complete |
| **HG-3** | Do NOT write code until failing test is documented (TDD) |
| **HG-4** | Do NOT proceed to Manual QA until Phase 4 test evidence is complete and Phase 4 is LOCKED |
| **HG-5** | Do NOT update global docs until user signs off on QA |
| **HG-6** | Do NOT start Phase N unless all prior phases are lock-valid |
| **HG-7** | Do NOT work on main branch without explicit consent |
| **HG-8** | Do NOT lock or advance a phase with unchecked TODO items |

**If a hard gate is violated:** STOP immediately, return to the skipped phase, complete it properly, lock it, then resume.

## 6. How it does it

- Reads `.codex/AGENTS.md` for local invocation conventions and `.agent/PLANS.md` for authoritative process rules.
- Runs single-command orchestration with auto-resume:
  - resume incomplete phases
  - create missing next-phase artifacts
  - block any phase advancement when prior artifacts are not lock-valid
  - forbid parallel phase work (no multi-phase DRAFT state)
  - never modify locked prior-phase artifacts
- Uses stage-local and upstream-gap addenda to preserve immutability while handling new findings.
- Uses `references/artifact-template.md` as the artifact-writing standard.
- **Enforces worktree isolation via `skills/rlm-worktree/SKILL.md`** - Phase 0 isolation before all other phases
- **Enforces TDD discipline via `skills/rlm-tdd/SKILL.md`** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles, The Iron Law
- **Supports systematic debugging via `skills/rlm-debugging/SKILL.md`** - Phase 1.5 root cause analysis
- **Enables parallel execution via `skills/rlm-subagent/SKILL.md`** - Subagent-driven execution with sequential fallback
- **Enforces TODO discipline** - Mandatory checkable TODOs in all phases; no locking with unchecked items

## 7. How to modify the workflow

Below are common customizations and exactly which file(s) to edit for each.

1. Change trigger phrases or when the main skill should activate.
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (frontmatter `description`)

2. Change phase behavior (for example, require an extra approval pause in Phase 3).
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (single-command contract and phase rules)
   - Edit: `references/plans-canonical.md` (full canonical PLANS text that gets upserted on install)
   - Edit: `references/artifact-template.md` (gates/checklists to match the new rule)

3. Change artifact format or required sections.
   - Edit: `references/artifact-template.md` (headers, traceability, gate templates)
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (phase execution protocol and expectations)

4. Change run folder structure or artifact file names.
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (run folder and artifact paths)
   - Edit: `references/artifact-template.md` (all template paths)
   - Edit: `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.ps1` and `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.py` (scaffold and inserted path references)

5. Change what gets inserted into `.codex/AGENTS.md` and `.agent/PLANS.md`.
   - Edit: `references/agents-block.md` (AGENTS managed block content)
   - Edit: `references/plans-canonical.md` (PLANS managed block content)
   - Edit: `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.ps1` and `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.py` only for upsert markers/settings behavior

6. Add or change global artifacts beyond `DECISIONS.md` and `STATE.md`.
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (global artifacts + phase expectations)
   - Edit: `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.ps1` and `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.py` (create/ensure those files)
   - Edit: `references/artifact-template.md` (if new required sections are needed)

7. Change testing policy (TDD depth, Playwright tagging, tier commands).
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (mandatory PLANS sections to enforce)
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-tdd/SKILL.md` (TDD discipline rules)
   - Edit: `references/artifact-template.md` (test summary and plan template sections)
   - Edit in target repo: `.agent/PLANS.md` (canonical testing rules)

8. Change systematic debugging process (Phase 1.5).
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-debugging/SKILL.md` (debugging methodology)
   - Edit: `references/plans-canonical.md` (Phase 1.5 integration)
   - Edit: `references/artifact-template.md` (Phase 1.5 template)

9. Change how installation/setup works.
   - Edit: `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.ps1`
   - Edit: `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.py`
   - Edit: `scripts/install-rlm-workflow.sh` (bash wrapper behavior)
   - Edit: `README.md` (installation instructions)
   - Edit: `skills/rlm-workflow-acp/SKILL.md` (Install Bootstrap section)
   - Note: installer guarantees `.agent/PLANS.md` exists after installation and only upserts managed blocks (never replaces unrelated existing content).

10. Update end-user documentation and examples.
   - Edit: `README.md`

11. Keep inserted AGENTS managed block content in sync after edits.
   - Edit: `references/agents-block.md` (single source of truth for AGENTS managed block)
   - Then re-run the installer against the target repo (see Bootstrap section)

## Optional Templates

Copy/paste prompt templates for agents that support custom commands:

- `docs/templates/commands/rlm-init.md` - prompt template to bootstrap a new run
- `docs/templates/commands/rlm-status.md` - prompt template to summarize run status
- `docs/templates/hooks/*` - optional hook templates (manual wiring only)

These are templates only; Skills CLI does not register commands/hooks automatically.

### Cross-Platform Skills

Skills are shared across all platforms via the `skills/` directory:
- `skills/rlm-worktree/SKILL.md` - Phase 0 worktree isolation
- `skills/rlm-tdd/SKILL.md` - TDD discipline for Phase 3
- `skills/rlm-debugging/SKILL.md` - Systematic debugging for Phase 1.5
- `skills/rlm-subagent/SKILL.md` - Parallel execution with fallback
